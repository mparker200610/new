        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a 15-year-old photographer from Adelaide, Australia. I have been doing photography for the past 3-4
            years and I enjoy it a lot. I first started doing photography after my Mum got me a GoPro hero 4 session for
            my birthday, I always used the photo mode on the camera and found cool things to photograph. After I
            practiced on the GoPro daily, I moved to an Olympus E-PL1, which I still use to this day. After I practiced
            with that camera, I got a Nikon d3000, which I do not use as regularly as I used to, but I used that camera
            the most and I practiced and practiced. After I developed my photography skills, I got another camera, which
            was a Canon 350 D, and I use it to this day. My most favourite thing to photograph is birds because they are
            unpredictable and you get a different image all the time. Photographing birds can also be challenging
            because it is hard to focus on them while they are flying, but I always manage to get a great image. I hope
            I could do photography for the rest of my life and my dream is to travel and take photos or work for
            National Geographic doing wildlife photography.</p>
